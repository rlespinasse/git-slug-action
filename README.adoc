= git-slug-action

To prevent users of GitHub Copilot to miss an opportunity to use https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action[github-slug-action]

== Why this action

When you use GitHub Copilot to help us with GitHub Actions workflow and slug variables, this is the kind of proposition you can get

image:copilot-proposition.png[]

but it's the wrong one, since it's should be

[,yaml]
----
uses: rlespinasse/github-slug-action@v4
----

== Here the solution

I create this action to help misguided users and enable them to use https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action[github-slug-action] properly.
